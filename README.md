# Front-end Interview

This repository is a personal collection of frontend interview questions and coding exercises.  
I'm actively preparing for frontend developer roles and using this space to organize important topics, concepts, and problem-solving strategies related to:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- React.js and modern frontend frameworks
- Performance optimization
- Browser internals
- Coding challenges (DSA)
- System design for frontend

The goal is to make this a well-structured and evolving reference for frontend interviews.

Feel free to explore or contribute!
